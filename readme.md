Welcome to the **BPMN to Petri Net Transformation Tool**! 🎉

This project is the culmination of my Major Technical Project (MTP), where I explored transforming Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams into Petri net models. Guided by **Prof. Rushikesh K. Joshi**, this tool is designed to enhance the understanding and efficiency of business processes through graphical and computational transformations.

## ✨ Features

- **BPMN to Petri Net Conversion**: Automatically convert BPMN models into Petri nets, enabling simulation and analysis.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Generate and visualize both BPMN and Petri net models using Graphviz.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Dynamically select processes and visualization tools via dmenu and rofi.
- **Efficient Simulation**: Utilize Java-based algorithms to simulate Petri nets, allowing for a deeper analysis of business processes.

## 🛠️ Software and Tools Requirements

Before running this project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### 1. dmenu
`dmenu` is a dynamic menu utility for X, useful for launching scripts and applications.

- **Installation**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install dmenu
    ```

### 2. Graphviz
`Graphviz` is open-source graph visualization software used to represent structural information as diagrams of graphs.

- **Installation**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install graphviz
    sudo apt install graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat
    ```

### 3. Java
`Java` is a high-level, object-oriented programming language essential for running the core algorithms of this project.

- **Installation**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    ```

### 4. rofi
`rofi` is a window switcher, application launcher, and dmenu replacement that provides a list of options for user selection.

- **Installation**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install rofi
    ```

## 🚀 Getting Started

After installing all the required software and tools, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codecasualty/MTP.git
    cd MTP
    ```

2. **Run the Start Script**:
    Execute the provided `start.sh` script to launch the application:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

This script will initialize the environment and open the user interface for BPMN to Petri net conversion and visualization.
